In this application I built a timed multiple choice quiz to test my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.

I set many parameters for the quiz. Clicking the Start Button launches a sequence of events. First a loaded timer appears and begins counting down in seconds. Additionally the user is presented with a multiple choice questions.

I made questions with different types of answers (both true/false and multiple choice) to prove that the buttons were made dynamically for each question.

Upon answering each question, the user is automatically presented with another question. If the user gets an answer wrong, 11 seconds are subtracted from the timer. Once the user answers all of the questions OR the timer reaches zero then the game is over. The user is then given the opportunity to store their initials and score.

This highly interactive application is housed in a classic and easy to read interface that offers a nod to websites of yore.
